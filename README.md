**Developed by Musabbir KM**

## üöÄ Overview

An end-to-end machine learning system that predicts heart disease risk using clinical features, featuring:
- **XGBoost Classifier** with automated threshold optimization
- **Streamlit Web Application** for interactive predictions
- **Comprehensive Model Evaluation** (ROC AUC: 0.909)
- **Production-Ready Pipeline** with feature engineering

## üåü Key Features
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Clinical Risk Assessment** | Classifies patients into High/Medium/Low risk categories |
| **Batch Processing** | Handles CSV uploads for multiple predictions |
| **Interactive Interface** | User-friendly Streamlit dashboard |
| **Model Explainability** | Detailed feature importance analysis |
| **Medical Recommendations** | Actionable insights based on risk level |

## üìä Dataset Information

    trestbps	Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
    chol	Serum cholesterol level (in mg/dl)
    fbs	Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false)
    restecg	Resting electrocardiographic results (0, 1, or 2)
    thalach	Maximum heart rate achieved
    exang	Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)
    oldpeak	ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
    slope	Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (1, 2, 3)
    ca	Number of major vessels (0‚Äì3) colored by fluoroscopy
    thal	Thalassemia (3 = normal, 6 = fixed defect, 7 = reversible defect)
